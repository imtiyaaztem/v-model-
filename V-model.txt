Advantages of V-model:
Simple and easy to use

Testing activities like planning, test designing happens well before coding.

This saves a lot of time. Hence higher chance of success over the waterfall model.

Proactive defect tracking – that is defects are found at early stage.

Avoids the downward flow of the defects.

Works well for small projects where requirements are easily understood.

Disadvantages of V-model:
Very rigid and least flexible.

Software is developed during the implementation phase, so no early prototypes of the software are produced.

If any changes happen in midway, then the test documents along with requirement documents has to be updated.
